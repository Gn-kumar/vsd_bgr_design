Lab 1:

Lab 1 is installation and cloning of required files , since we are doing it on cloud , codespace we dont need to install anything , everything is ready to use.
Use the following repos for technology files.
[eda-technology](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/eda-technology.git) and
[skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_pr.git](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_pr.git)
